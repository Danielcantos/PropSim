# PropSim
Pseudo 1-D performance simulator of solid propellant rocket motors

PropSim simulates the operation of a solid propellant rocket motor by discretizing the propellant grain into finite volumes. It takes into account motor ignition, steady-state and tail-off phases. It considers both ideal and non-ideal phenomena, such as nozzle throat erosion and presence of propellant cracks.

DISCLAIMER: HEAVY WIP, Personal project. Functionality IS NOT guaranteed.

This empty directory will be home to a Python port of the original simulator, upon which hopefully new releases will be developed.
